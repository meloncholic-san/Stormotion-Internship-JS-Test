# Match Game 

**This project is a JavaScript test assignment for Stormotion. The project is built with React.js and bundled using Parcel.**

## Assignment Description

The assignment involves creating a game where two players take turns playing. Starting from a pile of 25 matches, each player can take either 1, 2, or 3 matches on each turn. The game ends when all matches are taken, and the player with an even number of matches wins.

## Features

1. **First Player Turn:** The user can choose to take the first turn.
2. **Second Player Turn:** The user can choose to let the computer take the first turn.
3. **Customizable Settings:** Players can choose the total number of matches in the pool and the number of matches that can be taken in one turn, or they can play with default values.

## Computer Logic

The computer's logic is designed to leave the player with a number of matches that is a multiple of 4. This strategy increases the computer's chances of winning to 66%.
